<p class="thin"><a id="myid12" href=https://github.com/anushakartala/Palindromes>Palindromes:</a> Palindromes are character sequences that read the same forward or backwards (e.g. the strings "mom" or "123 454 321"). This program uses recursive functions to determine whether a string is a character-unit palindrome, and also implements flags to indicate case sensitive comparisons and spaces.</p>

<p class="thin"><a id="myid13" href=https://github.com/anushakartala/TemperatureQueries>Temperature Queries:</a> Created an algorithm for determining the average and mode as specified before implementing a linked list to organize temperature sensor readings from a file, and then processessing that file with queries to report based on the data.</p>

<p class="thin"><a id="myid14" href=https://github.com/anushakartala/AnnualGrowth>Annual Growth:</a> A simple program that receives the first name, last name, birth year, and height of the user  to then calculate their height in centimeters and compute the average annual growth per year.</p>

<p class="thin"><a id="myid15" href=https://github.com/anushakartala/MountainPaths>Mountain Paths:</a> This code reads elevation data and produces a file representing an image that, when visualized, displays each position on the map with a color that represents each elevation. By reading the data into a 2D vector, finding the min and max elevation, and computing the shade of gray for each cell in the map, I produced an output file. Using that output file, I then created a greedy algorithm to compute all paths (from the west to the east side of the terrain) that follow the policy of Ã¢ path of least resistance.</p>

<p class="thin"><a id="myid16" href=https://github.com/anushakartala/BullsAndCows>Bulls and Cows:</a> This program works with arrays to implement the guessing game Bulls and Cows. The game works like this: when a number is guessed and a digit is in the correct location, it is a bull. When a digit is in the number, but in the incorrect location, then it is a cow. This code will help guess the entire number by informing the user how many bulls and cows are in their guesses. So if a four-digit code is 2894, and the user guesses 4698, then that is "1 bull and 2 cows" because '9' is in the correct location and '4' and '8' are in the code but are currently in the wrong location. The guessing continues until the code is guessed in the correct order (e.g. 4 bulls).</p>

<p class="thin"><a id="myid17" href=https://github.com/anushakartala/GradeCalculator>Grade Calculator:</a> I used test-driven development, selection and iteration constructs, and functions to create a program that calculates my final grade in CSCE 121 according to the grading rubric in the syllabus.</p>

<p class="thin"><a id="myid18" href=https://github.com/anushakartala/QuadraticEquation>Quadratic Equation:</a> A simple program that inputs three coefficients (a, b, and c respectively) on a single line separated by spaces and then outputs the equation being solved along with each root on a seperate line.</p>
